This contains the text comments for 50,000 movie reviews from the [Internet Movie Database](https://www.imdb.com/). These data are splited in half so that we can get 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing. The training and testing sets are balanced and unbiased, which means they contain an equal number of positive and negative reviews.\n",

    "Let's assume that we have 9,999 positive reviews and 1 negative review. Without any training, we can get 99.99% accuracy by just predicting all reviews as positive. This situation is called the _Accuracy Paradox_. Since we're using accuracy as a model metric, it's important to **balance the dataset well**. In the case of MNIST dataset, we can say that the dataset is balanced when we have about 60,000/10=6,000 images per digit class. (60,000 is the total number of images and 10 is the number of class)"

    "To handle the text dataset, we first need to transform the data into a form that can be used for training. There are two common methods we can use when dealing with text data, **one-hot encoding** and **word embedding**. In this practice, we'll use one-hot encoding method (Word embedding will be covered later in the RNN part). Before using one-hot encoding, let's take a quick look at what one-hot encoding is.\n",

    "One-hot encoding is a vector representation of sentences. It has the **vector dimension as the size of the word set** and **1 is assigned to the index of the word to be expressed / 0 is assigned to the other index**. The detailed procedure of one-hot encoding is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Give each word an unique index.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) 1 is assigned to the index of the word to be expressed, and 0 is assigned otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",

    "<br/>\n",
    "Let's assume that we have a word dictionary that contains 7 words, 'today' ,'I' ,'was' ,'studied' ,'happy' ,'math' ,'not'. We can map these words to integers 0-6. \n",

    "<br/>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/onehot.png?raw=true\" width=300>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can represent sentences consisting of words from the dictionary. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a sentence 'I studied math today' can be represented as [0, 1, 3, 5] (not considering the order).\n",
    "If we make a vector that has the vector dimension as the size of the dictionary, we get a vector as below.\n",

    "#### Limitation of One-hot encoding\n",
    "One-hot encoding has the disadvantage that if the number of words increases, the space required to store the vector increases too. If we have 10,000 words that we want to express, regardless of the length of the sentence to be expressed, a vector of length 10,000 is required. (even for a sentence that contains only one word.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the one-hot vector encoding cannot express the similarity of words. Assume that we have 4 words 'wolf', 'dog', 'tiger', 'chair'. We can consider 'wolf', 'dog', 'tiger' have semantically similar context since they are all animals and 'chair' is less similar to the previous three words. In one-hot encoding, since inner-product similarity between two different words is always 0 and Euclidean distance between them is always $\\sqrt{2}$, there is no way to express the degree of similarity between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these shortcomings, one-hot encoding is easy to understand and use. Another reason for using the one-hot encding method is to check the overfitting problem in next practice. Therefore in this practice, we will use one-hot encoding.\n",
