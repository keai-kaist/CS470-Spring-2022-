    "Training the model is similar to preparing for the exam. When we prepare the exam, we often refer to past problems. However, the purpose of studying past problems is not just to solve them well. It is to solve upcoming problems well by studying patterns in past problems. Therefore memorizing past problems' answers to solve them will not help for the upcoming exams at all. The same goes for training the model. Just memorizing training data will not improve the accuracy for the unseen data. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we train the model too long, the model will start to overfit and learn patterns from the training data and eventually we get the model that doesn't generalize to the unseen data. We need to keep balance well between training data and test data. Understanding how can we choose an appropriate number of training epochs can be an useful skill. We call it **early stopping** (stop training before overfitting).\n",

    "There are many solutions to prevent overfitting and the best solution is to increase the training data. A model trained on many data will naturally generalize well (high accuracy for unseen data). If it is impossible to collect a large amount of training dataset, the next possible solution is to use techniques like **regularization**. Regularization imposes constraints on the quantity and type of information a model can store. If a network can only afford to memorize a small number of patterns, not the whole train data, the optimization process will force it to focus on the most prominent patterns, which will lead to a better chance of generalizing well.\n",

    "#### Demonstrate overfitting by various model size\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to prevent overfitting is to reduce the size of the model, i.e. the number of learnable parameters in the model. In deep learning, the number of learnable parameters in a model is often referred to as the model's **_capacity_**. Intuitively, a model with more parameters will have more memorization capacity and therefore will be able to easily learn a perfect dictionary-like mapping between training samples and their labels. **Note that a mapping without any generalization power is useless when making predictions on previously unseen data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if the network has a low capacity and limited memorization resources, it will not be able to learn the mapping as easily. Instead, in order to minimize its loss, **it will have to learn compressed representations that have more predictive power.** At the same time, if you make your model too small, **it will have difficulty fitting to the training data.** We need a balance between \"too much capacity\" and \"not enough capacity\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To find an appropriate model size empirically, it's good to start with relatively few layers and parameters and then start increasing the number of layers until you see performance decline by checking the validation loss or accuracy. Let's try this approach on our movie review classification network.\n",
