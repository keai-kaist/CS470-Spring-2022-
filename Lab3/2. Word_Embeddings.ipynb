    "#### One-hot encodings \n",
    "First method for representing the text as numbers is an \"one-hot\" encode each word in the vocabulary. Consider the sentence \"The cat sat on the mat\". The vocabulary (or unique words) in this sentence is (cat, mat, on, sat, the). To represent each word, we will create a zero vector with length equal to the number of the vocabularies, then place a one in the index that corresponds to the word. This approach is shown in the following diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "![One Hot Encodings](images/one-hot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a vector that contains the encoding of the sentence, we could then concatenate the one-hot vectors for each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, This approach has several downsides. \n",
    "1. One-hot encoding is very inefficient. \n",
    "- A one-hot encoded vector is sparse (meaning most indicies are zero). Imagine we have 10,000 words in the vocabulary. To one-hot encode each word, we would create a vector where 99.99% of the elements are zero.\n",
    "2. One-hot encoding cannot incorporate semantics between each word.\n",
    "- Every token in one-hot encoding is equally distant away from all the others. That is,\n",
    "\n",
    "![One-hot distance](images/one-hot-distance.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Word embeddings\n",
    "Word embeddings give us a way to use an efficient, dense representation in which similar words have a similar encoding. Importantly, we do not have to specify this encoding by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of specifying the values for the embedding manually, they are trainable parameters (weights learned by the model during training, in the same way a model learns weights for a dense layer). So, the neural network captures the token's meaning as a vector.  \n",
    "It is common to see word embeddings that are 8-dimensional (for small datasets), up to 1024-dimensions when working with large datasets. A higher dimensional embedding can capture fine-grained relationships between words, but takes more data to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Word Embeddings](images/embeddings.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Above is a diagram for a word embedding. Each word is represented as a 4-dimensional vector of floating point values. Another way to think of an embedding is as \"lookup table\". After these weights have been learned, we can encode each word by looking up the dense vector it corresponds to in the table.\n",
